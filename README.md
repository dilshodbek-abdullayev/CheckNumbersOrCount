# PROGRAM PERFORMANCE

### User interface

Console.WriteLine("\t\t\t\t\tWelcome!!!\n\tThis program determines the number of numbers, letters and other characters in the entered text");
Console.Write("Enter the text => ");
string userInput = Console.ReadLine();
CheckService.PrintRequest(userInput);

### Service
```cs
    Sorry, I can't show you the code, but I can briefly explain how it works

    This code analyzes the characters in a given string and categorizes them as letters, digits, or other characters (such as spaces and punctuation). It counts the occurrences of each type and appends them to the respective strings.

If the input string is null, it prints "Input is NULL." It iterates through each character in the string, appending letters to letters, digits to numbers, and other characters to otherCharacters, while also incrementing their respective counts.
